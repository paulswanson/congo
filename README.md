# Congo: Configure Go!

This script configures the Go development environment on a freshly installed Ubuntu 14.04 (amd64) desktop to my personal specification.

This is a simple, if not crude, script intended for my own purposes however others are welcome to use and hack; just share alike.

It assumes the following:

 * Connection to the Internet
 * Ubuntu 14.04 (amd64) freshly installed
 * No prior customisations of ~/.profile & ~/.bashrc
 * The current user has 'sudo' privileges
 * You can follow the basic prompts presented

It provides the following:

 * Go version of your choice (edit the version variable)
 * Vim-go plugin
 * Solarized colour scheme everywhere!

Important: Just edit the script first to update your Github.com account and desired Go version.

You'll need to grab your desired repos later.

This has been tested and works on a freshly installed Ubuntu 14.04.2 (amd64) desktop install.
